# SCRUM
### WHAT IS SCRUM?
 It is a framework that encourages teams to work together. It describes a set of tools, meeting and roles to help structure and manage work.Through scrums teams earn through experiences, self organise while working on problems, and reflecting on wins and losses to improve continuously therefore it can be applied almost anywhere.

## SPRINTS
### WHAT IS SPRINT 
 A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.
 A product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces

 Sprints make projects more manageable, allow teams to ship high-quality work faster and more frequently, and gives them more flexibility to adapt to change.Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live the agile value of "responding to change over following a plan." 



### In a sprint it’s important to make that:
 The backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order. 
 Sprint Planning meetings flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done.
 Leave out work where you won’t be able to get the dependencies donesomeone captures that information in your project management or collaboration tool, like your Jira tickets.

## Different Ceremonies in a sprint;
  There are different meetings (ceremonies) that make up the scrum framework;

### Backlog grooming - product owner, scrum master (30 minutes before sprint planning)
 Going over details with the product owner to make sure nothing is left out before going over things with developers. 
 A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements.

### Sprint planning - development team, scum master and product owner.(1 hour before sprint cycle)
 Discusses the object of the sprint; the what, how who and the inputs and ouputs of the sprint.

#### When planning a sprint you should;
 Setting a time limit for sprint planning
 Focus on theo utcomes not the work
 Estimates are required but don’t pretend you know more than you do


### Daily stand-up - development teaam, scrum master and product owner(15 minutes daily)
 Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team

### Iteration Review - Everyone may include project stakeholders( 30 -1 hour)
 This a showcase of work aka a demo

### Retrospect - Development team, scrum master, product owner and anyone who worked on the project (1 hour)
 Retrospectives help the team understand what worked well and what didn't to improve the way the team works.(feedback)
